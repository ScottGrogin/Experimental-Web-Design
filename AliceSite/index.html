                    <h2>Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>


                    <p>
                        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she
                        had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &lsquo;and
                        what is the use of a book,&rsquo; thought Alice &lsquo;without pictures or conversations?&rsquo;
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>




            <div class="page">
                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
                        the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
                        when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was nothing so
                        <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
                        <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &lsquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
                        late!&rsquo; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered
                        at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
                        <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started
                        to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
                        waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
                        after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not
                        a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
                    </p>


                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="page">
                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and
                        to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
                        coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed
                        that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung
                        upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &lsquo;ORANGE
                        MARMALADE&rsquo;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar
                        for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; thought Alice to herself, &lsquo;after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
                        How brave they&rsquo;ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything about it, even if
                        I fell off the top of the house!&rsquo; (Which was very likely true.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Down, down, down. Would the fall
                        <i>never</i> come to an end! &lsquo;I wonder how many miles I&rsquo;ve fallen by this time?&rsquo; she
                        said aloud. &lsquo;I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
                        be four thousand miles down, I think&mdash;&rsquo; (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things
                        of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a
                        <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still
                        it was good practice to say it over) &lsquo;&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s about the right distance&mdash;but
                        then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I&rsquo;ve got to?&rsquo; (Alice had no idea what Latitude
                        was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
                    </p>
