                    <h2>Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>


                    <p>
                        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she
                        had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &lsquo;and
                        what is the use of a book,&rsquo; thought Alice &lsquo;without pictures or conversations?&rsquo;
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>




            <div class="page">
                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
                        the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
                        when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was nothing so
                        <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
                        <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &lsquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
                        late!&rsquo; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered
                        at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
                        <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started
                        to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
                        waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
                        after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
                    </p>
