                    <h2>Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>


                    <p>
                        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she
                        had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &lsquo;and
                        what is the use of a book,&rsquo; thought Alice &lsquo;without pictures or conversations?&rsquo;
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>




            <div class="page">
                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
                        the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
                        when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was nothing so
                        <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
                        <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &lsquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
                        late!&rsquo; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered
                        at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
                        <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started
                        to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
                        waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
                        after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not
                        a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
                    </p>


                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="page">
                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and
                        to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
                        coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed
                        that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung
                        upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &lsquo;ORANGE
                        MARMALADE&rsquo;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar
                        for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; thought Alice to herself, &lsquo;after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
                        How brave they&rsquo;ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything about it, even if
                        I fell off the top of the house!&rsquo; (Which was very likely true.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Down, down, down. Would the fall
                        <i>never</i> come to an end! &lsquo;I wonder how many miles I&rsquo;ve fallen by this time?&rsquo; she
                        said aloud. &lsquo;I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
                        be four thousand miles down, I think&mdash;&rsquo; (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things
                        of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a
                        <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still
                        it was good practice to say it over) &lsquo;&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s about the right distance&mdash;but
                        then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I&rsquo;ve got to?&rsquo; (Alice had no idea what Latitude
                        was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
                    </p>


                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="page">
                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        Presently she began again. &lsquo;I wonder if I shall fall right
                        <i>through</i> the earth! How funny it&rsquo;ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their
                        heads downward! The Antipathies, I think&mdash;&rsquo; (she was rather glad there
                        <i>was</i> no one listening, this time, as it didn&rsquo;t sound at all the right word) &lsquo;&mdash;but
                        I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma&rsquo;am, is this
                        New Zealand or Australia?&rsquo; (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke&mdash;fancy
                        <i>curtseying</i> as you&rsquo;re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) &lsquo;And
                        what an ignorant little girl she&rsquo;ll think me for asking! No, it&rsquo;ll never do to ask: perhaps
                        I shall see it written up somewhere.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. &lsquo;Dinah&rsquo;ll miss me very much
                        to-night, I should think!&rsquo; (Dinah was the cat.) &lsquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll remember her saucer
                        of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air,
                        I&rsquo;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&rsquo;s very like a mouse, you know. But do
                        cats eat bats, I wonder?&rsquo; And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to
                        herself, in a dreamy sort of way, &lsquo;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&rsquo; and sometimes,
                        &lsquo;Do bats eat cats?&rsquo; for, you see, as she couldn&rsquo;t answer either question, it didn&rsquo;t
                        much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that
                        she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, &lsquo;Now, Dinah, tell
                        me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?&rsquo; when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap
                        of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
                    </p>

                            Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before
                            her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There
                            was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say,
                            as it turned a corner, &lsquo;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it&rsquo;s getting!&rsquo; She
                            was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she
                            found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
                            other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get
                            out again.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden
                            key, and Alice&rsquo;s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
                            but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would
                            not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had
                            not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
                            little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked
                        along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark
                        hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could
                        not even get her head through the doorway; &lsquo;and even if my head would go through,&rsquo; thought
                        poor Alice, &lsquo;it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut
                        up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.&rsquo; For, you see, so many out-of-the-way
                        things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
                        impossible.

                        There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another
                        key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found
                        a little bottle on it, (&lsquo;which certainly was not here before,&rsquo; said Alice,) and round
                        the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words &lsquo;DRINK ME&rsquo; beautifully printed
                        on it in large letters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was all very well to say &lsquo;Drink me,&rsquo; but the wise little Alice was not going to do
                        <i>that</i> in a hurry. &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll look first,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and see whether it&rsquo;s
                        marked &ldquo;
                        <i>poison</i>&rdquo; or not&rsquo;; for she had read several nice little histories about children who
                        had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
                        <i>would</i> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker
                        will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger
                        <i>very</i> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much
                        from a bottle marked &lsquo;poison,&rsquo; it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this bottle was
                        <i>not</i> marked &lsquo;poison,&rsquo; so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it
                        had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee,
                        and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

                        &lsquo;What a curious feeling!&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;I must be shutting up like a telescope.&rsquo;

                        And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right
                        size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a
                        few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this;
                        &lsquo;for it might end, you know,&rsquo; said Alice to herself, &lsquo;in my going out altogether,
                        like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?&rsquo; And she tried to fancy what the flame
                        of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such
                        a thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!
                        when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back
                        to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through
                        the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
                        and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Come, there&rsquo;s no use in crying like that!&rsquo; said Alice to herself, rather sharply; &lsquo;I advise you
                        to leave off this minute!&rsquo; She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom
                        followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and
                        once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she
                        was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
                        &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s no use now,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;to pretend to be two people!
                        Why, there&rsquo;s hardly enough of me left to make
                        <i>one</i> respectable person!&rsquo;

                    <p>
                        Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake,
                        on which the words &lsquo;EAT ME&rsquo; were beautifully marked in currants. &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll
                        eat it,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
                        makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I&rsquo;ll get into the garden,
                        and I don&rsquo;t care which happens!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, &lsquo;Which way? Which way?&rsquo;, holding her hand on the top of
                        her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained
                        the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into
                        the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid
                        for life to go on in the common way.

                    <p>
                        So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Curiouser and curiouser!&rsquo; cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to
                        speak good English); &lsquo;now I&rsquo;m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye,
                        feet!&rsquo; (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were
                        getting so far off). &lsquo;Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings
                        for you now, dears? I&rsquo;m sure
                        <i>I</i>
                        shan&rsquo;t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;&mdash;but
                        I must be kind to them,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;or perhaps they won&rsquo;t walk the way I want
                        to go! Let me see: I&rsquo;ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.&rsquo;
                    </p>

                        And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. &lsquo;They must go by the carrier,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;and
                        how funny it&rsquo;ll seem, sending presents to one&rsquo;s own feet! And how odd the directions
                        will look!
                    </p>


                    <p>Alice&rsquo;s Right Foot, Esq.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearthrug,</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near The Fender,</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(with Alice&rsquo;s love).</p>


                    <p>
                        Oh dear, what nonsense I&rsquo;m talking!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took
                        up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to
                        get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;a great girl like you,&rsquo; (she might well say this),
                        &lsquo;to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!&rsquo; But she went on all the
                        same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep
                        and reaching half down the hall.
                    </p>

                        After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
                        It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand
                        and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he
                        came, &lsquo;Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won&rsquo;t she be savage if I&rsquo;ve kept her waiting!&rsquo;
                        Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near
                        her, she began, in a low, timid voice, &lsquo;If you please, sir&mdash;&rsquo; The Rabbit started
                        violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard
                        as he could go.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:
                        &lsquo;Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I
                        wonder if I&rsquo;ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?
                        I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I&rsquo;m not the same, the next
                        question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,
                        <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the great puzzle!&rsquo; And she began thinking over all the children she knew that
                        were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not Ada,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn&rsquo;t
                        go in ringlets at all; and I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things,
                        and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides,
                        <i>she&rsquo;s</i> she, and
                        <i>I&rsquo;m</i> I, and&mdash;oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I&rsquo;ll try if I know all the things
                        I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times
                        seven is&mdash;oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table
                        doesn&rsquo;t signify: let&rsquo;s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the
                        capital of Rome, and Rome&mdash;no,
                        <i>that&rsquo;s</i> all wrong, I&rsquo;m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I&rsquo;ll try
                        and say &ldquo;
                        <i>How doth the little</i>&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were
                        saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did
                        not come the same as they used to do:&mdash;

                        &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure those are not the right words,&rsquo; said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she
                        went on, &lsquo;I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house,
                        and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I&rsquo;ve made
                        up my mind about it; if I&rsquo;m Mabel, I&rsquo;ll stay down here! It&rsquo;ll be no use their putting
                        their heads down and saying &ldquo;Come up again, dear!&rdquo; I shall only look up and say &ldquo;Who
                        am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I&rsquo;ll come up: if not,
                        I&rsquo;ll stay down here till I&rsquo;m somebody else&rdquo;&mdash;but, oh dear!&rsquo; cried Alice,
                        with a sudden burst of tears, &lsquo;I do wish they
                        <i>would</i> put their heads down! I am so
                        <i>very</i> tired of being all alone here!&rsquo;

                        As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit&rsquo;s little
                        white kid gloves while she was talking. &lsquo;How
                        <i>can</i> I have done that?&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;I must be growing small again.&rsquo; She got
                        up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess,
                        she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the
                        cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking
                        away altogether.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;That
                        <i>was</i> a narrow escape!&rsquo; said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very
                        glad to find herself still in existence; &lsquo;and now for the garden!&rsquo; and she ran with all
                        speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key
                        was lying on the glass table as before, &lsquo;and things are worse than ever,&rsquo; thought the
                        poor child, &lsquo;for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it&rsquo;s too bad,
                        that it is!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first
                        idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, &lsquo;and in that case I can go back by railway,&rsquo;
                        she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general
                        conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in
                        the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and
                        behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which
                        she had wept when she was nine feet high.

                        &lsquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t cried so much!&rsquo; said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. &lsquo;I shall
                        be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That
                        <i>will</i> be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:
                        at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was
                        now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Would it be of any use, now,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way
                        down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there&rsquo;s no harm in trying.&rsquo;
                        So she began: &lsquo;O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about
                        here, O Mouse!&rsquo; (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never
                        done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother&rsquo;s Latin Grammar, &lsquo;A
                        mouse&mdash;of a mouse&mdash;to a mouse&mdash;a mouse&mdash;O mouse!&rsquo;) The Mouse looked at
                        her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t understand English,&rsquo; thought Alice; &lsquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s a French mouse, come
                        over with William the Conqueror.&rsquo; (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very
                        clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: &lsquo;Ou est ma chatte?&rsquo;
                        which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water,
                        and seemed to quiver all over with fright. &lsquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!&rsquo; cried Alice hastily,
                        afraid that she had hurt the poor animal&rsquo;s feelings. &lsquo;I quite forgot you didn&rsquo;t
                        like cats.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Not like cats!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. &lsquo;Would
                        <i>you</i> like cats if you were me?&rsquo;

                        &lsquo;Well, perhaps not,&rsquo; said Alice in a soothing tone: &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could
                        show you our cat Dinah: I think you&rsquo;d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is
                        such a dear quiet thing,&rsquo; Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool,
                        &lsquo;and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face&mdash;and
                        she is such a nice soft thing to nurse&mdash;and she&rsquo;s such a capital one for catching mice&mdash;oh,
                        I beg your pardon!&rsquo; cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and
                        she felt certain it must be really offended. &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t talk about her any more if you&rsquo;d
                        rather not.&rsquo;

                        &lsquo;We indeed!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. &lsquo;As if
                        <i>I</i> would talk on such a subject! Our family always
                        <i>hated</i> cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don&rsquo;t let me hear the name again!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t indeed!&rsquo; said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. &lsquo;Are you&mdash;are
                        you fond&mdash;of&mdash;of dogs?&rsquo; The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: &lsquo;There
                        is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier,
                        you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it&rsquo;ll fetch things when you throw them,
                        and it&rsquo;ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember
                        half of them&mdash;and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it&rsquo;s so useful, it&rsquo;s
                        worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and&mdash;oh dear!&rsquo; cried Alice in a
                        sorrowful tone, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve offended it again!&rsquo; For the Mouse was swimming
                        away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So she called softly after it, &lsquo;Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won&rsquo;t talk about cats or dogs either,
                        if you don&rsquo;t like them!&rsquo; When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back
                        to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice,
                        &lsquo;Let us get to the shore, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you my history, and you&rsquo;ll understand
                        why it is I hate cats and dogs.&rsquo;

                        It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there
                        were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
                        way, and the whole party swam to the shore.

                        They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank&mdash;the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with
                        their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

                        The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed
                        quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all
                        her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would
                        only say, &lsquo;I am older than you, and must know better&rsquo;; and this Alice would not allow
                        without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no
                        more to be said.

                    <p>
                        At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, &lsquo;Sit down, all of you, and listen
                        to me!
                        <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> soon make you dry enough!&rsquo; They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with
                        the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch
                        a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Ahem!&rsquo; said the Mouse with an important air, &lsquo;are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence
                        all round, if you please! &ldquo;William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was
                        soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation
                        and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; said the Lory, with a shiver.

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I beg your pardon!&rsquo; said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: &lsquo;Did you speak?&rsquo;

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Not I!&rsquo; said the Lory hastily.

                        The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, &lsquo;&ldquo;&mdash;found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling
                        to meet William and offer him the crown. William&rsquo;s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
                        of his Normans&mdash;&rdquo; How are you getting on now, my dear?&rsquo; it continued, turning to
                        Alice as it spoke.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;As wet as ever,&rsquo; said Alice in a melancholy tone: &lsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t seem to dry me at all.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, &lsquo;I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate
                        adoption of more energetic remedies&mdash;&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Speak English!&rsquo; said the Eaglet. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what&rsquo;s
                        more, I don&rsquo;t believe you do either!&rsquo; And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:
                        some of the other birds tittered audibly.

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;What I was going to say,&rsquo; said the Dodo in an offended tone, &lsquo;was, that the best thing to get us dry would
                        be a Caucus-race.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;What
                        <i>is</i> a Caucus-race?&rsquo; said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused
                        as if it thought that
                        <i>somebody</i> ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the Dodo, &lsquo;the best way to explain it is to do it.&rsquo; (And, as you might like to try the
                        thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (&lsquo;the exact shape doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rsquo; it said,) and
                        then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no &lsquo;One, two, three,
                        and away,&rsquo; but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it
                        was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or
                        so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out &lsquo;The race is over!&rsquo; and they
                        all crowded round it, panting, and asking, &lsquo;But who has won?&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed
                        upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while
                        the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, &lsquo;
                        <i>Everybody</i> has won, and all must have prizes.&rsquo;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;But who is to give the prizes?&rsquo; quite a chorus of voices asked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Why,
                        <i>she</i>, of course,&rsquo; said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party
                        at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, &lsquo;Prizes! Prizes!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the
                        salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all
                        round.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;But she must have a prize herself, you know,&rsquo; said the Mouse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; the Dodo replied very gravely. &lsquo;What else have you got in your pocket?&rsquo; he went on,
                        turning to Alice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Only a thimble,&rsquo; said Alice sadly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Hand it over here,&rsquo; said the Dodo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying &lsquo;We beg your acceptance
                        of this elegant thimble&rsquo;; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could
                        not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could
                        not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over
                        at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

                        she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Mine is a long and a sad tale!&rsquo; said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;It
                        <i>is</i> a long tail, certainly,&rsquo; said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse&rsquo;s tail;
                        &lsquo;but why do you call it sad?&rsquo; And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking,
                        so that her idea of the tale was something like this:&mdash;

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Alice very humbly: &lsquo;you had got to the fifth bend, I think?&rsquo;

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I had
                        <i>not</i>!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;A knot!&rsquo; said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. &lsquo;Oh, do let
                        me help to undo it!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I shall do nothing of the sort,&rsquo; said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. &lsquo;You insult me by talking
                        such nonsense!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it!&rsquo; pleaded poor Alice. &lsquo;But you&rsquo;re so easily offended, you know!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Mouse only growled in reply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Please come back and finish your story!&rsquo; Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, &lsquo;Yes,
                        please do!&rsquo; but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;What a pity it wouldn&rsquo;t stay!&rsquo; sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab
                        took the opportunity of saying to her daughter &lsquo;Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never
                        to lose
                        <i>your</i>
                        temper!&rsquo; &lsquo;Hold your tongue, Ma!&rsquo; said the young Crab, a little snappishly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re enough to
                        try the patience of an oyster!&rsquo;

                        &lsquo;I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!&rsquo; said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. &lsquo;She&rsquo;d
                        soon fetch it back!&rsquo;

                    <p>
                        Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: &lsquo;Dinah&rsquo;s our cat. And she&rsquo;s such
                        a capital one for catching mice you can&rsquo;t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the
                        birds! Why, she&rsquo;ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!&rsquo;

                    <p>
                        This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping
                        itself up very carefully, remarking, &lsquo;I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn&rsquo;t
                        suit my throat!&rsquo; and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, &lsquo;Come
                        away, my dears! It&rsquo;s high time you were all in bed!&rsquo; On various pretexts they all moved
                        off, and Alice was soon left alone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t mentioned Dinah!&rsquo; she said to herself in a melancholy tone. &lsquo;Nobody seems to like
                        her, down here, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder
                        if I shall ever see you any more!&rsquo; And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
                        lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps
                        in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and
                        was coming back to finish his story.

                        It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;
                        and she heard it muttering to itself &lsquo;The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur
                        and whiskers! She&rsquo;ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where
                        <i>can</i> I have dropped them, I wonder?&rsquo; Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the
                        fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
                        they were nowhere to be seen&mdash;everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool,
                        and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.

                    <p>
                        Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, &lsquo;Why, Mary Ann,
                        what
                        <i>are</i> you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick,
                        now!&rsquo; And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed
                        to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.

                        out who I am! But I&rsquo;d better take him his fan and gloves&mdash;that is, if I can find them.&rsquo;
                        As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate
                        with the name &lsquo;W. RABBIT&rsquo; engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried
                        upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before
                        she had found the fan and gloves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;How queer it seems,&rsquo; Alice said to herself, &lsquo;to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah&rsquo;ll
                        be sending me on messages next!&rsquo; And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen:
                        &lsquo;&ldquo;Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!&rdquo; &ldquo;Coming in
                        a minute, nurse! But I&rsquo;ve got to see that the mouse doesn&rsquo;t get out.&rdquo; Only I don&rsquo;t
                        think,&rsquo; Alice went on, &lsquo;that they&rsquo;d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
                        people about like that!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan
                        and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and
                        was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.
                        There was no label this time with the words &lsquo;DRINK ME,&rsquo; but nevertheless she uncorked
                        it and put it to her lips. &lsquo;I know
                        <i>something</i> interesting is sure to happen,&rsquo; she said to herself, &lsquo;whenever I eat or
                        drink anything; so I&rsquo;ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it&rsquo;ll make me grow
                        large again, for really I&rsquo;m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!&rsquo;
                    </p>


                </div>

                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing
                        against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the
                        bottle, saying to herself &lsquo;That&rsquo;s quite enough&mdash;I hope I shan&rsquo;t grow any more&mdash;As
                        it is, I can&rsquo;t get out at the door&mdash;I do wish I hadn&rsquo;t drunk quite so much!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another
                        minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against
                        the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource,
                        she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself &lsquo;Now I
                        can do no more, whatever happens. What
                        <i>will</i> become of me?&rsquo;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,
                        and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder
                        she felt unhappy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;It was much pleasanter at home,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;when one wasn&rsquo;t always growing larger and
                        smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t gone down that
                        rabbit-hole&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;it&rsquo;s rather curious, you know, this sort of life!
                        I do wonder what
                        <i>can</i> have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never
                        happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that
                        there ought! And when I grow up, I&rsquo;ll write one&mdash;but I&rsquo;m grown up now,&rsquo; she
                        added in a sorrowful tone; &lsquo;at least there&rsquo;s no room to grow up any more
                        <i>here</i>.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;But then,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;shall I
                        <i>never</i> get any older than I am now? That&rsquo;ll be a comfort, one way&mdash;never to be an old
                        woman&mdash;but then&mdash;always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t like
                        <i>that</i>!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Oh, you foolish Alice!&rsquo; she answered herself. &lsquo;How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there&rsquo;s hardly
                        room for
                        <i>you</i>, and no room at all for any lesson-books!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after
                        a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
                    </p>

                        &lsquo;Mary Ann! Mary Ann!&rsquo; said the voice. &lsquo;Fetch me my gloves this moment!&rsquo; Then came a little pattering
                        of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till
                        she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit,
                        and had no reason to be afraid of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice&rsquo;s elbow
                        was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself &lsquo;Then
                        I&rsquo;ll go round and get in at the window.&rsquo;

                        <i>That</i> you won&rsquo;t&rsquo; thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the
                        Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She
                        did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
                        from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
                        of the sort.

                    <p>
                        Next came an angry voice&mdash;the Rabbit&rsquo;s&mdash;&lsquo;Pat! Pat! Where are you?&rsquo; And then a voice she had never
                        heard before, &lsquo;Sure then I&rsquo;m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Digging for apples, indeed!&rsquo; said the Rabbit angrily. &lsquo;Here! Come and help me out of
                        <i>this</i>!&rsquo; (Sounds of more broken glass.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Now tell me, Pat, what&rsquo;s that in the window?&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s an arm, yer honour!&rsquo; (He pronounced it &lsquo;arrum.&rsquo;)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Sure, it does, yer honour: but it&rsquo;s an arm for all that.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!&rsquo;

                        There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, &lsquo;Sure, I don&rsquo;t
                        like it, yer honour, at all, at all!&rsquo; &lsquo;Do as I tell you, you coward!&rsquo; and at last
                        she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
                        <i>two</i> little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. &lsquo;What a number of cucumber-frames
                        there must be!&rsquo; thought Alice. &lsquo;I wonder what they&rsquo;ll do next! As for pulling me
                        out of the window, I only wish they
                        <i>could</i>! I&rsquo;m sure
                        <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to stay in here any longer!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a
                        good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the other ladder?&mdash;Why,
                        I hadn&rsquo;t to bring but one; Bill&rsquo;s got the other&mdash;Bill! fetch it here, lad!&mdash;Here,
                        put &lsquo;em up at this corner&mdash;No, tie &lsquo;em together first&mdash;they don&rsquo;t reach
                        half high enough yet&mdash;Oh! they&rsquo;ll do well enough; don&rsquo;t be particular&mdash;Here,
                        Bill! catch hold of this rope&mdash;Will the roof bear?&mdash;Mind that loose slate&mdash;Oh, it&rsquo;s
                        coming down! Heads below!&rsquo; (a loud crash)&mdash;&lsquo;Now, who did that?&mdash;It was Bill,
                        I fancy&mdash;Who&rsquo;s to go down the chimney?&mdash;Nay,
                        <i>I</i> shan&rsquo;t!
                        <i>You</i> do it!&mdash;
                        <i>That</i> I won&rsquo;t, then!&mdash;Bill&rsquo;s to go down&mdash;Here, Bill! the master says you&rsquo;re
                        to go down the chimney!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Oh! So Bill&rsquo;s got to come down the chimney, has he?&rsquo; said Alice to herself. &lsquo;Shy, they seem to put
                        everything upon Bill! I wouldn&rsquo;t be in Bill&rsquo;s place for a good deal: this fireplace is
                        narrow, to be sure; but I
                        <i>think</i> I can kick a little!&rsquo;

                        She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn&rsquo;t guess
                        of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying
                        to herself &lsquo;This is Bill,&rsquo; she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen

                        up his head&mdash;Brandy now&mdash;Don&rsquo;t choke him&mdash;How was it, old fellow? What happened

                        Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Bill,&rsquo; thought Alice,) &lsquo;Well, I hardly know&mdash;No

                        &lsquo;We must burn the house down!&rsquo; said the Rabbit&rsquo;s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, &lsquo;If
                        you do. I&rsquo;ll set Dinah at you!&rsquo;

                    <p>
                        There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, &lsquo;I wonder what they
                        <i>will</i> do next! If they had any sense, they&rsquo;d take the roof off.&rsquo; After a minute or
                        two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, &lsquo;A barrowful will do, to
                        begin with.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;A barrowful of
                        <i>what</i>?&rsquo; thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little
                        pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put
                        a stop to this,&rsquo; she said to herself, and shouted out, &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better not do that
                        again!&rsquo; which produced another dead silence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright
                        idea came into her head. &lsquo;If I eat one of these cakes,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s

                        So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small
                        enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals
                        and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two
                        guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment
                        she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;The first thing I&rsquo;ve got to do,&rsquo; said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, &lsquo;is to
                        grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think
                        that will be the best plan.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the
                        smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little
                        sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
                        &lsquo;Poor little thing!&rsquo; said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
                        it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which
                        case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.

                    <p>
                        Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped
                        into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made
                        believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over;
                        and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled
                        head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game
                        of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the
                        thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little
                        way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat
                        down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

                <p>
                    This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and
                    out of breath, and till the puppy&rsquo;s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lsquo;And yet what a dear little puppy it was!&rsquo; said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and
                    fanned herself with one of the leaves: &lsquo;I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if&mdash;if
                    I&rsquo;d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I&rsquo;d nearly forgotten that I&rsquo;ve got
                    to grow up again! Let me see&mdash;how
                    <i>is</i> it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question
                    is, what?&rsquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not
                    see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large
                    mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on
                    both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the
                    top of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large
                    caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking
                    not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.

                    <p>
                        The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
                        mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
                    </p>

                        &lsquo;Who are
                        <i>you</i>?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &lsquo;I&mdash;I hardly know, sir, just
                        at present&mdash;at least I know who I
                        <i>was</i> when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.&rsquo;

                        &lsquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar sternly. &lsquo;Explain yourself!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t explain
                        <i>myself</i>, I&rsquo;m afraid, sir&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;because I&rsquo;m not myself, you see.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t put it more clearly,&rsquo; Alice replied very politely, &lsquo;for I can&rsquo;t understand
                        it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Well, perhaps you haven&rsquo;t found it so yet,&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;but when you have to turn into a chrysalis&mdash;you
                        will some day, you know&mdash;and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you&rsquo;ll feel
                        it a little queer, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Not a bit,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;all I know is, it would feel very queer to
                        <i>me</i>.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;You!&rsquo; said the Caterpillar contemptuously. &lsquo;Who are
                        <i>you</i>?&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar&rsquo;s
                        making such
                        <i>very</i> short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, &lsquo;I think, you ought
                        to tell me who
                        <i>you</i> are, first.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="page">
                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be
                        in a
                        <i>very</i> unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Come back!&rsquo; the Caterpillar called after her. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve something important to say!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Keep your temper,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
                        hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took
                        the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, &lsquo;So you think you&rsquo;re changed, do you?&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I am, sir,&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t remember things as I used&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
                        keep the same size for ten minutes together!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t remember
                        <i>what</i> things?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve tried to say &ldquo;How doth the little busy bee,&rdquo; but it all came different!&rsquo; Alice
                        replied in a very melancholy voice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Repeat, &ldquo;

                        &lsquo;Not
                        <i>quite</i> right, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; said Alice, timidly; &lsquo;some of the words have got
                        altered.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;It is wrong from beginning to end,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;What size do you want to be?&rsquo; it asked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not particular as to size,&rsquo; Alice hastily replied; &lsquo;only one doesn&rsquo;t like changing
                        so often, you know.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I
                        <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Are you content now?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Well, I should like to be a
                        <i>little</i> larger, sir, if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; said Alice: &lsquo;three inches is such
                        a wretched height to be.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;It is a very good height indeed!&rsquo; said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly
                        three inches high).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m not used to it!&rsquo; pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, &lsquo;I wish
                        the creatures wouldn&rsquo;t be so easily offended!&rsquo;
                    </p>

                        &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to it in time,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking
                        again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of
                        its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled
                        away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, &lsquo;One side will make you grow taller, and the
                        other side will make you grow shorter.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;One side of
                        <i>what</i>? The other side of
                        <i>what</i>?&rsquo; thought Alice to herself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Of the mushroom,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out
                        of sight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and
                        as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched
                        her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;And now which is which?&rsquo; she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:
                        the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking
                        rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely
                        against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed
                        to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.

                        &lsquo;Come, my head&rsquo;s free at last!&rsquo; said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment,
                        when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down,
                        was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that
                        lay far below her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;What
                        <i>can</i> all that green stuff be?&rsquo; said Alice. &lsquo;And where
                        <i>have</i> my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can&rsquo;t see you?&rsquo; She
                        was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among
                        the distant green leaves.

                        As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted
                        to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded
                        in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found
                        to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
                        her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with
                        its wings.

                        &lsquo;Serpent!&rsquo; screamed the Pigeon.

                        &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
                        <i>not</i> a serpent!&rsquo; said Alice indignantly. &lsquo;Let me alone!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Serpent, I say again!&rsquo; repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
                        tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rsquo; said Alice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve tried the roots of trees, and I&rsquo;ve tried banks, and I&rsquo;ve tried hedges,&rsquo; the Pigeon went
                        on, without attending to her; &lsquo;but those serpents! There&rsquo;s no pleasing them!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;As if it wasn&rsquo;t trouble enough hatching the eggs,&rsquo; said the Pigeon; &lsquo;but I must be on the look-out
                        for serpents night and day! Why, I haven&rsquo;t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!&rsquo;

                        &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry you&rsquo;ve been annoyed,&rsquo; said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;And just as I&rsquo;d taken the highest tree in the wood,&rsquo; continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek,
                        &lsquo;and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling
                        down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m
                        <i>not</i> a serpent, I tell you!&rsquo; said Alice. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a&mdash;I&rsquo;m a&mdash;&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Well!
                        <i>What</i> are you?&rsquo; said the Pigeon. &lsquo;I can see you&rsquo;re trying to invent something!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m a little girl,&rsquo; said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she
                        had gone through that day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;A likely story indeed!&rsquo; said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a good many
                        little girls in my time, but never
                        <i>one</i>
                        with such a neck as that! No, no! You&rsquo;re a serpent; and there&rsquo;s no use denying it. I suppose you&rsquo;ll be
                        telling me next that you never tasted an egg!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I
                        <i>have</i> tasted eggs, certainly,&rsquo; said Alice, who was a very truthful child; &lsquo;but little
                        girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; said the Pigeon; &lsquo;but if they do, why then they&rsquo;re a kind of serpent,
                        that&rsquo;s all I can say.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of
                        adding, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re looking for eggs, I know
                        <i>that</i> well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you&rsquo;re a little girl or a serpent?&rsquo;
                    </p>

                        &lsquo;It matters a good deal to
                        <i>me</i>,&rsquo; said Alice hastily; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and
                        if I was, I shouldn&rsquo;t want
                        <i>yours</i>: I don&rsquo;t like them raw.&rsquo;

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Well, be off, then!&rsquo; said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched
                        down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
                        and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still
                        held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one
                        and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded
                        in bringing herself down to her usual height.

                    <p>
                        It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to
                        it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. &lsquo;Come, there&rsquo;s half my plan
                        done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I&rsquo;m never sure what I&rsquo;m going to be, from
                        one minute to another! However, I&rsquo;ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into
                        that beautiful garden&mdash;how
                        <i>is</i> that to be done, I wonder?&rsquo; As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place,
                        with a little house in it about four feet high. &lsquo;Whoever lives there,&rsquo; thought Alice,
                        &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll never do to come upon them
                        <i>this</i> size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!&rsquo; So she began nibbling at the
                        righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to
                        nine inches high.

                <h2> Chapter 6: Pig and Pepper</h2>
                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
                        running out of the wood&mdash;(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise,
                        judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)&mdash;and rapped loudly at the door with
                        his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like
                        a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She
                        felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over
                        to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, &lsquo;For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play
                        croquet.&rsquo; The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the
                        words a little, &lsquo;From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped
                        out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly
                        up into the sky.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no sort of use in knocking,&rsquo; said the Footman, &lsquo;and that for two reasons. First, because
                        I&rsquo;m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they&rsquo;re making such a
                        noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.&rsquo; And certainly there
                        <i>was</i> a most extraordinary noise going on within&mdash;a constant howling and sneezing, and every
                        now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Please, then,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;how am I to get in?&rsquo;
                    </p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="page">
                <div class="pagetxt">
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;There might be some sense in your knocking,&rsquo; the Footman went on without attending to her, &lsquo;if we had
                        the door between us. For instance, if you were
                        <i>inside</i>, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.&rsquo; He was looking up into the
                        sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. &lsquo;But perhaps he
                        can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; she said to herself; &lsquo;his eyes are so
                        <i>very</i> nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.&mdash;How am I
                        to get in?&rsquo; she repeated, aloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I shall sit here,&rsquo; the Footman remarked, &lsquo;till tomorrow&mdash;&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman&rsquo;s head: it
                        just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;&mdash;or next day, maybe,&rsquo; the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;How am I to get in?&rsquo; asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;
                        <i>Are</i> you to get in at all?&rsquo; said the Footman. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the first question, you
                        know.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s really dreadful,&rsquo; she muttered to herself,
                        &lsquo;the way all the creatures argue. It&rsquo;s enough to drive one crazy!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. &lsquo;I shall sit here,&rsquo;
                        he said, &lsquo;on and off, for days and days.&rsquo;
                    </p>

                        &lsquo;But what am
                        <i>I</i> to do?&rsquo; said Alice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Anything you like,&rsquo; said the Footman, and began whistling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no use in talking to him,&rsquo; said Alice desperately: &lsquo;he&rsquo;s perfectly idiotic!&rsquo;
                        And she opened the door and went in.
                    </p>

                        The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a
                        three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a
                        large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        &lsquo;There&rsquo;s certainly too much pepper in that soup!&rsquo; Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing
                        and howling alternately without a moment&rsquo;s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not
                        sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;Please would you tell me,&rsquo; said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners
                        for her to speak first, &lsquo;why your cat grins like that?&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a Cheshire cat,&rsquo; said the Duchess, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s why. Pig!&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
                        to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:&mdash;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn&rsquo;t know that cats
                        <i>could</i> grin.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;They all can,&rsquo; said the Duchess; &lsquo;and most of &lsquo;em do.&rsquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any that do,&rsquo; Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know much,&rsquo; said the Duchess; &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rsquo;
                    </p>
